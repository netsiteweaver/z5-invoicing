## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Mobile Card Pattern
```html
<!-- Mobile cards (visible on small screens) -->
<div class="sm:hidden space-y-4">
    @foreach($items as $item)
        <div class="bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-4">
            <!-- Card content -->
        </div>
    @endforeach
</div>

<!-- Desktop table (hidden on small screens) -->
<div class="hidden sm:block bg-white shadow rounded-lg">
    <!-- Table content -->
</div>
```

### Collapsible Filters Pattern
```html
<div class="bg-white shadow rounded-lg" x-data="{ mobileOpen: false }">
    <div class="p-4 sm:p-6">
        <!-- Mobile toggle -->
        <div class="flex items-center justify-between sm:hidden">
            <span class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Filters</span>
            <button type="button" @click="mobileOpen = !mobileOpen">

        <!-- Form -->
        <div class="mt-4 sm:mt-0" x-cloak x-show="mobileOpen || window.matchMedia('(min-width: 640px)').matches">
            <!-- Filter form -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
